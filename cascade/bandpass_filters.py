"""Implementations of bandpass filters for separating different spatial scales 
from two-dimensional images in the frequency domain. The input images are assumed 
to have square shape.

The methods in this module implement the following interface:

  filter_xxx(L, n, optional arguments)

where L is size of the input field, respectively, and n is the number of 
frequency bands to use.

The output of each filter function is a dictionary containing the following 
key-value pairs:

  weights_1d       2d array of shape (n, L/2) containing 1d filter weights 
                   for each frequency band k=1,2,...,n
  weights_2d       3d array of shape (n, L, L) containing the 2d filter weights 
                   for each frequency band k=1,2,...,n
  central_freqs    1d array of shape n containing the central frequencies of the 
                   filters

The filter weights are assumed to be normalized so that for any Fourier 
wavenumber they sum to one.

# TODO: Should the filter always return an 1d array and should we use a separate 
# method for generating the 2d filter from the 1d filter?
